# Max Sum Sub-array
### Comparing 4 algorithms' efficiency in finding the largest sum in a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.

Each of our four algorithms are in a separate .cpp file and a common header file between them.
- ```main.cpp``` contains the code to the driver program.
- MSS_Problems.txt is the text file given to us by the professor for input.
- MSS_Results.txt is the text file generated after running our code.
   - Note that if you run it more than once, it will append the results to MSS_Results.txt.

To compile:
- make
- make mss

To run:
- ```mss <input_file_name.extension>```
   - ie: mss MSS_Problems.txt

To remove: 
- make clean
