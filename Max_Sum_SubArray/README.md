# Max Sum Subarray
### Comparing 4 algorithms' efficiency in finding the largest sum in a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers.

## AlgCodeAndResults
Contains the header file and .cpp files for each of the algorithms as well as the driver to run the algorithms

## ExperimentalAnalysis
Contains the code to run the algorithms and output the respective runtime on randomly generated arrays of ```n``` elements.
